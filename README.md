# NVS
A simple Network Vulnerability Scanner written in Python.</br>
Utilizes Nmap to perform scans on a host.</br>
The main focus of this script was user having a user friendly interface,</br>
to perform Nmap scans with.

# Installation
Simply clone the repository</br>
Install nmap and the following packages via pip:
- python3-nmap or nmap3
- termtables

# Background
The reason i made this project was zAnti,</br>
a mobile pentesting framework build for Android.</br>
And maybe, just maybe, i was simply bored.</br>
The issue is that zAnti has stopped receiving updates for a while now.</br>
On top of that i wanted a way of running scans with a cleaner interface on my laptop without having to run an emulator.</br>
If you manually perform nmap scans its not really nice to look at the output.</br></br>

I am aware that the code may seem messy and that there is a lot that can be improved.</br>
It was simply a project i whipped up on the weekend.</br>
If you notice any bugs feel free to post an issue and ill have a look.
