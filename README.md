# NVS
A simple Network Vulnerability Scanner written in Python.
Utilizes Nmap to perform scans on a host.
The main focus of this script was user having a user friendly interface,
to perform Nmap scans with.

The reason i made this project was zAnti, 
a mobile pentesting framework build for Android.
And maybe, just maybe, i was simply bored.
The issue is that zAnti has stopped receiving updates for a while now. 
On top of that i wanted a way of running scans with a cleaner interface on my laptop without having to run an emulator.
If you manually perform nmap scans its not really nice to look at the output.

I am aware that the code may seem messy and that there is a lot that can be improved.
It was simply a project i whipped up on the weekend.
If you notice any bugs feel free to post an issue and ill have a look.
